GMU Guesser, written with React in TypeScript is a fun twist on the popular webbrowser game GeoGuesser. Players are dropped in a random location within the GMU Campus, and they must figure out where they are located on a map. There will be 3 rounds, each with a different environment. The closer your guess is to the actual location, the more points you score!

# Features
1. Join games of Sphere Pictures around campus.
2. Look around and try to remember your way around campus.
3. Focus and scour the map until you find an ideal location.
4. Select the place you want to guess.
5. Look back at the Sphere Photo and re-evaulate. 
6. Pick somewhere else if you find something better.
7. Submit your guess and move on to the next round!
8. After 3 rounds: view your score, reflect, and play again!
